- ### Snake five (and counting) ways
    It's become somewhat of a ritual for me to write a snake game in languages I pick up as a first project. The (relatively) simple implementation of game rules and low (but present) graphical requirements make for an ideal beginner project, especially given that in doing so I learn about the language's approach to user input, rendering a simple window (or printing graphics to a terminal), constructing a working game loop and implementing complex (ish) logic, skills that are foundational to most other intermediate/advanced techniques in CS.

    - #### [Python](/snake_5_ways/Python) (with Pygame)
        - My first major project in Computer Science, undertaken in winter 2020/spring 2021. Before this I'd never dabbled in graphics in any language, so the Pygame module was a massive help in making the process beginner-friendly. There are definitely some sharp corners, but I'm quite proud of it especially considering it was the first of its kind.

    - #### [C++](/snake_5_ways/C++)
        - After getting comfortable with basic CS concepts in Python, I took the leap of exploring lower-level languages. While C was a bit too daunting for me at the time, C++ had a lot more beginner-friendly documentation and tutorials on sites like stackoverflow so I worked my way up to a text-based version of the game, using the ncurses Window class and its methods to print colored text to the terminal to display the game window

    - #### HTML/JS (with JavaScript's Canvas)
